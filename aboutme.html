                    <h2>Hi. Welcome!</h2>

                    <p>Thanks for dropping by! My name is Nguyen and I built this website with the intension to show off some of the projects I worked on for fun, and some of the stuff I like to do.</p>
                    <p>I spend a lot of my time coding and learning new things. I suppose I can say that I have a passion for learning! I am also an avid photographer (a newbie of course) and an outdoor adventurer.</p>

                <h2>Coding:</h2>
                <p>I code mostly in C++, HTML/CSS, Javascript and Visual Basic but I am learning C#.NET to familiarize myself with .NET platform. I am looking forward to learn <a href="http://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> next.</p>
                <p>
                    I am currently interested in distributed systems
                        such as <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> (Amazon Web Services) and <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com">Azure</a> (Microsoft Azure).

                <h2>Photography:</h2>
                <p>I am a Nikon fan and you can guess what DSLR I have. You're right! I have a <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d7000.htm">Nikon D7000</a> and it's been a great camera and friend to me.
                It's like a buddy that I won't forget to bring along with wherever I go.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="large-indent-4 column">
            <p>I am mainly a landscape photographer but occasionally street photography as well. Hence, that's why I always carry my <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/24mm-f28-afd.htm">24mm f/2.8D</a> prime lens with me.
             I don't have much to say about that lens except that it is a sharp and fast lens. Overall, it is an amazing lens that I would recommend it to anyone that owns a Nikon out there!</p>

                <h2>Road Biking:</h2>
                <p>I started getting into road biking recently and I must say that it's a very enjoyable sport/recreation. 
                    I learned how to ride a bicycle since I was younger but I never knew that riding a road bike requires different riding technicques. </p>

            <div class="large-indent-4 column">
                <p>I ride a Fuji Roubaix 1.0 and it's a pretty comfortable ride (for a road bike!). Every road bike is different and this one has that "snappy" feeling which I like.</p>
                <p>My favourite bike trails so far are the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/manhattan-beach-bike-path-manhattan-beach">Manhattan Beach Trail</a> and the <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/santa-ana-river-trail-orange">Santa Ana River Trail</a>.
                    So if you want to catch me, you will probably find me on one of those trails!
